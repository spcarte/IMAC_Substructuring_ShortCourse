# Common Problems in FBS
This section of the FBS examples will demonstrate how common issues can lead to errors in the FBS coupled FRFs. It will go over the four examples:
1. Measurement errors in the substructure FRFs
2. Slight differences in natural frequencies, simulating the effects of nonlinearities 
3. Small positional errors in the coupling DOFs
4. Excluding torsional DOFs in the coupling FRFs

```{note}
The examples shown here use relatively simple problem set-ups, which may reduce the significance of the errors that they are trying to demonstrate.

## Process for the Common Problem Examples
The process for some of these examples is slightly more convoluted than what was done in the fundamental FBS examples, since extra steps are required to introduce the errors. The unique process for each example will be described in the associated notebook.
