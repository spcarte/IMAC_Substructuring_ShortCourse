# IMAC XLIV Substructuring ShortCourse
This respository contains the course content and sample code for the IMAC XLIV substructuring shortcourse.

## Additional Helpful Information
The examples in the [SDynPy](https://sandialabs.github.io/sdynpy/examples.html) and [pyFBS](https://pyfbs.readthedocs.io/en/master/theory/theory.html) documentation may provide additional helpful information on dynamic substructuring. While these examples show how to use the different Python packages, they also provide a significant amount of theoretical content.
