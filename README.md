# IMAC XLIV Substructuring ShortCourse
This respository contains the course content and sample code for the IMAC XLIV substructuring shortcourse. The files are organized as:

- The __FBS_Example_Code__ folder contains the FBS examples. The Jupyter notebooks (the .ipynb files) are the example scripts. Alternatively, the FBS examples can also be reviewed [on the web here](https://spcarte.github.io/IMAC_Substructuring_ShortCourse/).
- ...

Note that the contents of the .github folder, readme.md file, and fbs_example_requirements.txt file are primarily included to format the repository and deploy the FBS example webpage. These files are not required for any section of the course.

The primary dependancies for the FBS examples (except for Python and Jupyter Notebook) can be installed with the following terminal command:

```{python}
pip install -r fbs_example_requirements.txt
```

## Downloading the Repository
The contents of the repository can be downloaded by clicking the `<>Code` button that is near the upper right of the page, then clicking "Download ZIP". The contents can also be downloaded, file-by-file if desired. 

## Additional Helpful Information
The examples in the [SDynPy](https://sandialabs.github.io/sdynpy/examples.html) and [pyFBS](https://pyfbs.readthedocs.io/en/master/theory/theory.html) documentation may provide additional helpful information on dynamic substructuring. While these examples show how to use the different Python packages, they also provide a significant amount of theoretical content for substructuring, the virtual point transformation, and transfer path analysis.
